##Summary 

The project is centered around creating a breadth-first traversal with iteration of a given graph, as well as the depth-first traversal. This is done through the implementations of two packages: ADTpackage and GraphPackage. Graphpackage class contains VertexInterface.java with its implementaion class Vertex.java, as well as BasicGraphInterface.java with its implementation class DirectedGraph.java. ADTPackage includes StackInterface for the depth-first traversal with its implementation LinkedStack.java, QueueInterface.java, used for breadth-first traversal, with its implementation LinkedQueue.java. The package also includes ListInterface.java implemented in LinkedListWithIteration, and DictionaryInterface.java implemented in the class LinkedDictionary.java which attatches a key to the vertices to help search for them. Our driver class is GraphTraversalDriver.java, which displays both traversals along with the number of verticies, edges, and adjaceny matrix/list.
